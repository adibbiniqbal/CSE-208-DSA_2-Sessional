/**
 * Jan25 CSE208 
 * Practice Session on BFS/DFS
 * 
 * 
 * Complete the following code by implementing the functions. Please be mindful of the corner cases. 
 * Run the provided input file. 
 * Be ready to explain the generated output to the evaluator.
 * 
 * 
 * The usage of any online tool and/or any GenAI is absolutely forbidden in this course 
 * unless otherwise mentioned. 
 * 
 * 
 * You may consider the following:
 *  
 * BFS(Graph, start_node):
    # Create a queue to store nodes to be explored
    # Create a set to track visited nodes
    
    # Start from the initial node and enqueue it
   
    # While the queue is not empty
        # Dequeue a node from the queue
        # Process the current node (e.g., print it or store it)
        # For each neighbor of the current node
            # If the neighbor has not been visited
                # Mark the neighbor as visited and enqueue it
 * 
 * 
 * DFS(Graph, current_node, visited):
    # Mark the current node as visited
    # Process the current node (e.g., print it or store it)
    
    # For each neighbor of the current node
        # If the neighbor has not been visited
            # Recursively call DFS on the neighbor
            DFS(Graph, neighbor, visited)
